description: '"I have often been asked to select and epitomize the practical and especially
  the pedagogical conclusions of my large volumes on Adolescence, published in 1904,
  in such form that they may be available at a minimum cost to parents, teachers,
  reading circles, normal schools, and college classes, by whom even the larger volumes
  have been often used. This, with the cooperation of the publishers and with the
  valuable aid of Superintendent C. N. Kendall of Indianapolis, I have tried to do,
  following in the main the original text, with only such minor changes and additions
  as were necessary to bring the topics up to date, and adding a new chapter on moral
  and religious education. For the scientific justification of my educational conclusions
  I must, of course, refer to the larger volumes. The last chapter is not in "Adolescence,"
  but is revised from a paper printed elsewhere"--Preface. (PsycINFO Database Record
